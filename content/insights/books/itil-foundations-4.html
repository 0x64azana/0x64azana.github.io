	  <h3>Critique</h3>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
ITIL Foundation, 4th Edition serves as an introduction to Information Technology management, and it fulfills that purpose effectively.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  As I read the book, it became clear how business and IT are interconnected, working together to create a smooth, efficient workflow. Although the book was easy to read, I found that its key concepts could essentially be summarized on a single page. Before the exam, I relied on that one-page summary graph to review and study. Compared to Project+, which focuses more on structured, regulated workflows, this book emphasizes fluid communication and how to move effectively from point A to point B.

	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
Compared to something like Project+, I believe this book and its accompanying exam provide an excellent introduction to management â€” not just in IT, but in general.
