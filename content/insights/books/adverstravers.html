	  <h3>Critique</h3>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">This book is intended for intermediate/advanced security practitioners. It is a methodical book that is easy to read and introduces trains of thought for offensive and defensive perspectives.</p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Dan Borges has been a member of the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition's red team for several years and gives insights into the processes conducted by both hackers and defenders in a competitive environment. This book covers practical information, including setting up honeypots, log management, numerous exploits, and track-hiding techniques. The book emphasizes understanding adversaries' mindsets, goals, and tradecrafts. To glaze further, it even covers defensive countermeasures.</p>
	  <p>This book is a must-read for competitors. It's easy to follow along, and Dan does a great job sharing his methodology. The only downside, in my opinion, is that I would only specifically recommend this to competitors, although there is much to learn from this book.</p>
