	  <h3>Critique</h3>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  This book was quite the read. The certification is often compared to CompTIA's Security+. Still, they were completely different, with the information in this book being more applicable and less about simply knowing acronyms. Having done both exams, I argue that this information holds more value.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  This CBK Reference covers security regarding networks, systems, and applications. It also covers access controls, incident response, and cryptography. If you read between the lines, you'll find the story of a day-to-day SOC Analyst regarding how and what is expected to be security best practices.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  As the book progresses, it is apparent how everything ties together nicely with chapters constantly referencing material from previous chapters. It's very easy to read and follow along, with key points being the objective instead of the specifics of technical constraints.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  I recommend this book to anyone aspiring to become a NOC / SOC team member. This book was my only source for the exam, although I will admit it gives false information. While reading, I found three inaccuracies (this is a lot for a knowledge base reference!) A solid example of what I mean by this is that the error types per the book are type 1 = negative and type 2 = positive, when in reality, it's the other way around.
