	  <h3>Critique</h3>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  This book might serve as a reference to keep on your shelf, but I did not find it enjoyable, and overall, I consider it of poor quality.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  This book goes into the various things you can do with Python, including but not limited to creating sockets, clients, servers, shellcodes, and using Python as a type of Live Off The Land solution. It goes into these topics and more by giving the reader programs to copy over with little explanation on how they actually work and how to adapt the libraries used to be versatile.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  Although it covers many important concepts, the book is difficult to read and understand. In my view, you need to be already familiar with the material to get anything out of it, as it does not explain concepts clearly or thoroughly enough. One might argue that "you simply need to do further research yourself," but you can't search for what you don't know is missing.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  This opinion might be controversial, but I don't think this book is a good read. It's not enjoyable, and the knowledge base it attempts to deliver isn't done efficiently.
