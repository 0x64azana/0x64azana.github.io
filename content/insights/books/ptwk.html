	  <h3>Critique</h3>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	   This PDF is provided to those who have purchased the OSCP course from OffSec and serves as an introduction to penetration testing.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	   This was one of the first resources I read on my journey into cybersecurity. It effectively teaches both methodology and tools. OffSec released this PDF as a complete guide on how to pass the OSCP. Although penetration testing is not a linear process and cannot be mastered with a single PDF alone, this file does an excellent job introducing the various aspects needed during a pentest. Without the information contained in this PDF, I would never have been able to kickstart my career in cybersecurity.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	   As a source of knowledge, this PDF is undeniably a treasure. It is very easy to read and follow, with great pacing throughout. Overall, this is probably the resource I have referred to the most over time.
