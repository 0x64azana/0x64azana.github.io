	  <h3>Critique</h3>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  Cryptography has a well-documented history, with the earliest versions used before and during the Roman Empire. This book, Cryptography, written by William J. Buchanan, gives a great storyline of the history of cryptography, where it's at, and where it's going.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  This book is a knowledge base with the main characters Bob, Alice, and eavesdropping Eve. William starts by breaking down each well-known cryptographic algorithm and how they're implemented smoothly using standard Python and the C programming language to recreate them. As the book progresses, we see different real-world applications, such as implementing PKI, digital signatures, and political issues that came with designing a strong standard for encryption.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Cryptography is used globally and is not an easy subject to cover. This book finds a way to convey the information it wants to nicely. One thing I would add to this book is more examples. Although everything is explained as it is, sometimes it takes more to hammer in that metaphorical nail.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
	  This book was a breath of fresh air from what I typically read. I would only recommend this book to intermediates with a curiosity for more knowledge. After all, cryptography is just. In the same way, Breathing is just. (It's mostly always applied by default)
