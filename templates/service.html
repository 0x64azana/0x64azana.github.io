<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
  A <strong style="color: #f0f;">System Security Audit</strong> is a comprehensive examination of your IT environment designed to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and recommend improvements to protect your systems, data, and business operations.
</p>

<h3>The Process:</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Initial Consultation &amp; Scope Definition</strong>:<br/>
  We begin by discussing your business goals, systems, and specific concerns. Together, we define the audit’s scope, including which systems, networks, applications, and devices will be reviewed.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Information Gathering</strong>:<br/>
  We collect details about your infrastructure — hardware, software, network setup, user access levels, and existing security policies — and review relevant documentation.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Vulnerability Assessment</strong>:<br/>
  We use automated tools and manual techniques to scan your systems for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, outdated software, and potential entry points.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Manual Review &amp; Testing</strong>:<br/>
  Beyond automated scanning, we manually analyze configurations, check for weak passwords, unpatched software, privilege escalation risks, and assess real-world attack scenarios.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Risk Analysis</strong>:<br/>
  Each finding is evaluated based on its potential impact, likelihood of exploitation, and urgency. We prioritize the most critical issues and explain their implications.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Reporting</strong>:<br/>
  You receive a detailed, clear report summarizing all findings, their severity, and actionable recommendations to mitigate risks and strengthen security.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Presentation &amp; Consultation</strong>:<br/>
  We meet with you to walk through the report, answer questions, and help you plan your next steps toward remediation and improvement.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Follow-Up (Optional)</strong>:<br/>
  If requested, we assist with implementing the recommendations, perform re-testing, or offer ongoing security monitoring to ensure continued protection.
</p>

	  <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
	  <h3>Pricing!</h3>
	  We offer a base price starting at <strong style="color: $f0f;">$60</strong>, which includes a full assessment of your primary system. For environments with multiple machines or devices, we charge an incremental rate per additional machine or service, ensuring you only pay for what you need while still receiving a comprehensive evaluation of your entire infrastructure.
