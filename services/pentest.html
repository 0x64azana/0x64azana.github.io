<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
  A <strong style="color: #f0f;">Penetration Test</strong> is a simulated attack on your IT environment, designed to uncover real-world vulnerabilities, demonstrate how attackers could exploit them, and help you strengthen your defenses before an actual breach occurs.
</p>

<h3>The Process:</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Initial Consultation &amp; Scope Definition</strong>:<br/>
  We begin by discussing your business goals, systems, and specific concerns. Together, we define the test’s scope, including which systems, networks, applications, and devices will be targeted.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Information Gathering</strong>:<br/>
  We collect details about your infrastructure — hardware, software, network topology, and publicly available information — to understand potential attack surfaces and craft realistic scenarios.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Vulnerability Identification</strong>:<br/>
  We perform reconnaissance and scanning to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, outdated software, and weak defenses that attackers could exploit.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Exploitation &amp; Testing</strong>:<br/>
  Using ethical hacking techniques, we attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities in a controlled manner to demonstrate potential impacts without causing harm to your systems or data.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Risk Analysis</strong>:<br/>
  Each successful or potential exploit is evaluated based on its impact, likelihood, and the level of access it provides. We prioritize findings to help you address the most critical risks first.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Reporting</strong>:<br/>
  You receive a clear, detailed report that documents the vulnerabilities, evidence of exploitation (where applicable), their severity, and step-by-step remediation recommendations.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Presentation &amp; Consultation</strong>:<br/>
  We walk you through the report in a presentation or consultation session, explain the findings, and help you plan corrective actions.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <strong style="color: #f0f;">Follow-Up (Optional)</strong>:<br/>
  Upon request, we assist with remediation efforts, perform re-testing to validate fixes, and can provide ongoing testing or monitoring to maintain your security posture.
</p>

<h3>Pricing!</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
  We offer a base price starting at <strong style="color: #f0f;">$150</strong>, which includes a penetration test of your primary system. For environments with multiple machines, applications, or services, we charge an incremental rate per additional target, ensuring you only pay for what you need while still receiving a thorough and realistic security evaluation.
